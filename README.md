# Connect4 AI

Arthur is a expert level Connect 4 AI to play against. Made in Android Studio with Java to create game/GUI. Utilized a minimax
algorithum to have AI look to all possible future moves to determine best move to make. Added alpha beta pruning to 
decrease computation time. 

Please feel free to clone the project and play around with the code. This algorithum can be applied to many boardgames such as 
TICTACTOE or OTHELLO when a scoring system is established. For games with a games with a extremely large number of possible moves such as CHESS for which you can't compute the entire tree a 'heuristic' would have to be established to give an estimate score.

# Connect4 AI

Arthur is a expert level Connect 4 AI to play against. Made in Android Studio with Java to create game/GUI. Utilized a minimax
algorithum and alpha to have AI look to all possible future moves to determine best move to make. Added alpha beta pruning to 
decrease computation time. 

Please feel free to clone the project and play around with the code. This algorithum can be applied to many boardgames such as 
chess or othello when a scoring system is established.
